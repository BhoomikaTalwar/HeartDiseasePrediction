Heart Disease Prediction Web App:
This project is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various health parameters. The app utilizes a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) trained on a heart disease dataset and is built using Python with Flask as the backend framework. The frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the app both functional and responsive.

Features
Interactive Form: Users can input their medical data, such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and more, through a user-friendly form.
Real-time Predictions: Upon submitting the form, the app sends the data to the backend, where the machine learning model processes the input and provides a prediction.
Responsive Design: The frontend is built with a clean and responsive design, ensuring usability across various devices.
ML Model: A logistic regression model is trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the input data.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
Model Serialization: pickle
Dataset: The model is trained on a heart disease dataset with features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.
